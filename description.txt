r/Terraria Mod is a compilation of concepts I've come across while browsing through r/Terraria.
I will update this mod depending on how fast concepts come out and if I even see them.

Want me to mod something for you? Message me on Discord (pollen__#0487) or DM on Reddit (u/suddenlyurmomgay) and send me your concept.

Note:
The skeleton skull item and the shaman's mask should make you immune to pre-hardmode skeletons. If I missed a type of skeleton please let me know so I can fix it.
